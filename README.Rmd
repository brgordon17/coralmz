Coralmz is an R package that is a collection of coral mass spectral features.
All features have been identified either in coral or closely related organisms 
such as their symbionts. All features were obtained from peer reviewed research articles (referenced within the table) and have, as a minimum, a level 1 metabolite identification according to the Proposed Minimum Reporting Standards for Chemical Analysis (Sumner et al. 2007).

For more information about the package please see the
package [DESCRIPTION](DESCRIPTION).

### Usage

You can install this released version of coralmz as a package in R using the
devtools package:

``` r
devtools::install_github("brgordon17/coralmz")
```

Alternatively, the table can be downloaded as either a `.csv` file or an `.rda` 
file from from the `data/` directory [here](data/).
