Coralmz is a simple R package that contains a database of coral mass spectral 
features published in the coral and natural products research literature. It
contains the data as both a `.csv` file and an `.rda` file for easier loading a
function to search the data. Coralmz was originally created by 
Benjamin R. Gordon with the assistance of Cherie Motti for use in his Ph.D 
thesis. All features have a minimum level one metabolite identification 
according to the Proposed Minimum Reporting Standards for Chemical Analysis 
(Sumner et. al. 2007).

### Usage

You can install this released version of coralmz as a package in R using the
devtools package:

``` r
devtools::install_github("brgordon17/coralmz")
```

Alternatively, the data can be downloaded as either a `.csv` file or a `.rda` 
file from from the `/data` directory [here](/data).

### Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the database you can [open an issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue)
and give me your suggestions. Alternatively, you can also 
[fork this repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)
and create a 
[pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
